# Generate Complete Business Plans with Customizable AI Models and Specialized Agents

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates the generation of a comprehensive, professional business plan structured into 14 official chapters and their detailed subchapters. Its primary use case is to transform raw user input ideas about a business into a fully fleshed-out business plan by leveraging specialized AI agents, each responsible for a distinct business plan chapter or section. The output is a polished Markdown file ready for investor presentations, internal strategy, or operational guidance.

The workflow is logically divided into the following blocks:

- **1.1 Input Reception:** Captures the initial user business idea input via chat.
- **1.2 Master Outlining:** The main “Outliner Agent” transforms this raw input into a detailed 14-chapter business plan outline according to a strict structure.
- **1.3 Specialized Chapter Expansion:** Dedicated LangChain agents expand each chapter outline into detailed blueprints, each handling a specific chapter and its subchapters.
- **1.4 Finalizing Subchapters:** Further specialized agents finalize individual subchapters into polished, professional text sections.
- **1.5 Chapter Assembly:** Code nodes merge the multiple subchapter outputs into consolidated chapter texts.
- **1.6 Complete Plan Assembly:** Merge nodes and a final code node concatenate all chapters into one full business plan text.
- **1.7 Output Generation:** Converts the final text to a downloadable Markdown file.

  - Edge cases: Network failures, malformed input, webhook misconfiguration.

#### 2.2 Master Outlining

- **Overview:** Generates a comprehensive 14-chapter business plan outline strictly following the official structure, organizing user input into chapters and subchapters.
- **Nodes Involved:**  
  - *Outliner Agent*  
- **Node Details:**  
  - Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`  
  - Role: AI agent acting as Master Business Plan Outliner.  
  - Configuration: Receives raw user idea; prompt enforces strict 14-chapter structure with predefined subchapters.  
  - Key Expression: Uses `{{ $json.chatInput }}` to inject user input.  
  - Output: JSON outline detailing each chapter and subchapter.  
  - Connections: Splits output to multiple specialized chapter agents.  
  - Edge cases: LLM errors, incomplete user input, logical inconsistencies.

#### 2.3 Specialized Chapter Expansion

- **Overview:** Each chapter agent takes the outline for its chapter and expands it into detailed blueprints, specifying content requirements and delegation instructions for subchapters.
- **Nodes Involved:**  
  - 13 agents named by chapter, e.g., “1. Executive Summary Chapter Agent”, “2. Business Description Outliner Agent”, ..., “13. Exit Strategy Outliner Agent”  
- **Node Details:**  
  - Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`  
  - Role: Chapter-specific AI agents expanding outlines into detailed writing blueprints.  
  - Configuration: Each receives the relevant chapter outline via `{{ $json.output }}`.  
  - Output: Structured blueprints for subchapters including research, content, and delegation notes.

### 4. Reproducing the Workflow from Scratch

1. **Create Trigger Node:**
   - Node: *When chat message received*
   - Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger`
   - Set as public webhook.
   - Purpose: Receive raw user business idea input.

2. **Add Master Outline Agent:**
   - Node: *Outliner Agent*
   - Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`
   - Configure prompt to generate a detailed 14-chapter business plan outline based on input `{{ $json.chatInput }}`.
   - Connect trigger output to this node.

3. **Add Specialized Chapter Outliner Agents (13 nodes):**
   - Names:  
     - “1. Executive Summary Chapter Agent”  
     - “2. Business Description Outliner Agent”  
     - “3. Market Analysis Outliner Agent”  
     - … up to “13. Exit Strategy Outliner Agent”
   - Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`
   - Each receives the respective chapter outline from Master Outliner.
   - Configure prompt to expand outline into detailed writing blueprints with delegation notes.

4. **Add Subchapter Finalizing Agents for Each Chapter:**
   - Create one agent per subchapter (e.g., “1.1 Mission Statement Final Agent1”, “1.2 Vision Statement Final Agent”, …).
   - Type: `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`
   - Input: Blueprint from chapter outliner.
   - Configure prompt to produce polished, professional subchapter text.

5. **Add Chapter Merger Nodes:**
   - For each chapter, add a `merge` node (`n8n-nodes-base.merge`) with `numberInputs` matching subchapter count.
   - Connect all subchapter finalizing agents to their chapter merger.

6. **Add Chapter Assembler Code Nodes:**
   - For each chapter, add a `code` node to:
     - Decode and fix newlines in subchapter texts.
     - Assemble the chapter text in Markdown format with section titles.
   - Connect chapter merger output to assembler node.

7. **Add Merge Nodes for Complete Plan Assembly:**
   - Create `merge` nodes to:
     - Merge chapters 1-10 outputs.
     - Merge chapters 11-13 outputs.
     - Final merge of these two merges.

8. **Add Final Result Organizer Code Node:**
   - Concatenate all chapter texts with spacing into one Markdown string.
   - Use `code` node with JavaScript to combine inputs.

9. **Add Convert to File Node:**
   - Node: `n8n-nodes-base.convertToFile`
   - Operation: To text
   - Filename: `business plan.md`
   - Input: Final Markdown string from result organizer.

10. **Set Up Credentials:**
    - Configure the LLM credential (e.g., Ollama API) for all LangChain agent nodes.
    - Ensure webhook accessibility and authentication as needed.

11. **Connection Order:**
    - Trigger → Outliner Agent
    - Outliner Agent → All Chapter Outliner Agents
    - Each Chapter Outliner Agent → Its respective Subchapter Finalizing Agents
    - Subchapter Finalizing Agents → Chapter Merger
    - Chapter Merger → Chapter Assembler
    - Chapter Assemblers → Merge nodes (1-10, 11-13)
    - Merged outputs → Final merge
    - Final merge → Result Organizer → Convert to File

12. **Default Values & Constraints:**
    - Ensure each agent prompt strictly follows the 14-chapter business plan structure.
    - Use error handling for webhook and LLM calls.
    - Maintain consistent input/output property names for chaining.
