## How It Works 
This workflow aggregates data from GitHub repositories containing statistics about workflow creators and their templates. It processes this data, filters it based on user input, and generates a detailed Markdown report using an AI agent. 

### Key Features 
1. **Data Aggregation**: Fetches creator and workflow statistics from GitHub JSON files. 
2. **Custom Filtering**: Focuses on specific creators based on a username provided via chat. 
3. **AI-Powered Reports**: Generates comprehensive Markdown reports with summaries, tables, and insights. 
4. **Output Flexibility**: Saves reports locally with timestamps for easy access. 

### Data Retrieval & Processing 
- **Creators Data**: Retrieved via an HTTP Request node from a JSON file containing aggregated statistics about creators. 
- **Workflows Data**: Pulled from another JSON file with workflow metrics like visitor counts and inserter statistics. 
- **Data Merging**: Combines creator and workflow data by matching usernames to provide enriched statistics. 

### Report Generation 
The AI agent generates a Markdown report that includes: 
- A summary of the creator's contributions. 
- A table of workflows with key metrics (e.g., unique visitors, inserters). 
- Insights into trends or community feedback. 
The report is saved locally as a file with a timestamp for tracking purposes.
