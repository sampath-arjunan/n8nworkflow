# Receive updates for Calendly events

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow is designed to receive real-time updates from Calendly about event invitee changes. Specifically, it listens for two types of Calendly events: when an invitee is created (a new booking) and when an invitee is canceled. The workflow acts as a companion example for the Calendly Trigger node documentation, demonstrating how to capture and process webhook events from Calendly.

**Logical Blocks:**

- **1.1 Input Reception:** The single block in this workflow involves receiving webhook events from Calendly via the Calendly Trigger node. It sets up the webhook listener and defines which event types to monitor.

### 2. Block-by-Block Analysis

#### 1.1 Input Reception

- **Overview:**  
  This block sets up and manages the webhook listener to receive event notifications from Calendly. It captures invitee creation and cancellation events and serves as the entry point for any downstream processing (not included in this workflow).

- **Nodes Involved:**  
  - Calendly Trigger

- **Node Details:**

  - **Name:** Calendly Trigger  
  - **Type:** Calendly Trigger (Webhook Trigger node)  
  - **Technical Role:** Listens for specific Calendly webhook events (invitee.created and invitee.canceled) and triggers the workflow when such events occur.  
  - **Configuration Choices:**  
    - Monitors two event types: `invitee.created` and `invitee.canceled` to track new bookings and cancellations.  
    - Uses a webhook ID `9d13bcea-781a-4462-a9af-44bfb1fb6891` assigned by n8n to uniquely identify and listen on the webhook URL.  
    - Uses credentials named `calendly_creds` configured with the Calendly API access token to authenticate webhook registration and verification.  
  - **Key Expressions or Variables:** None explicitly configured beyond event types.  
  - **Input Connections:** None (trigger node).  
  - **Output Connections:** None defined in this workflow (could be connected downstream for processing).  
  - **Version-Specific Requirements:** Requires n8n version supporting the Calendly Trigger node (typeVersion 1 is used here).  
  - **Edge Cases / Potential Failures:**  
    - Credential authentication failure if Calendly API token is invalid or expired.  
    - Webhook registration failure if Calendly API is unreachable or rate-limited.  
    - Network issues causing missed webhook delivery.  
    - Unhandled event types if Calendly adds new events not listed here.  
  - **Sub-workflow Reference:** None.

| Node Name       | Node Type            | Functional Role                 | Input Node(s) | Output Node(s) | Sticky Note |

### 4. Reproducing the Workflow from Scratch

1. **Create the Calendly Trigger node:**  
   - Add a new node of type **Calendly Trigger** to your workflow canvas.  
   - Configure the node to listen for the following events:  
     - `invitee.created`  
     - `invitee.canceled`  
   - Set or confirm the webhook URL generated by n8n (automatically assigned or can be customized).  
2. **Set up credentials:**  
   - Create or select an existing **Calendly API** credential in n8n. This requires a valid Calendly API token with permissions to register webhooks.  
   - Attach this credential to the Calendly Trigger node’s credential setting.  
3. **Save and activate the workflow:**  
   - Save the workflow and activate it to start listening for Calendly events.  
4. **Test the setup:**  
   - Perform a test booking or cancellation in Calendly to verify the webhook triggers the workflow correctly.  
5. **Optional downstream processing:**  
   - Connect additional nodes after the trigger to process event data as needed (not included in this workflow).
