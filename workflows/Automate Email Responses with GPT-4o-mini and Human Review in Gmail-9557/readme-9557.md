# Automate Email Responses with GPT-4o-mini and Human Review in Gmail

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates email response generation for incoming Gmail messages using the GPT-4o-mini language model, incorporating a human-in-the-loop review process before sending replies to customers. It is designed primarily for sales or customer engagement teams aiming to efficiently respond to inbound inquiries while maintaining quality control via human approval.

The workflow is logically divided into four key phases:

- **1.1 Email Intake & Classification:** Watches incoming Gmail emails and uses AI to classify potential sales leads or relevant inquiries.
- **1.2 AI Draft Generation:** Generates a first draft reply using a structured prompt and GPT-4o-mini, enforcing output formatting to ensure stability.
- **1.3 Human Review & Iteration Loop:** Sends the AI-generated draft to a human reviewer who can approve or request revisions, looping back as needed.
- **1.4 Final Action:** Once approved, sends the polished email reply to the original customer.

### 2. Block-by-Block Analysis

---

#### 2.1 Email Intake & Classification

**Overview:**  
This initial block listens for new emails in a Gmail account and classifies each email to determine whether it is a potential AI-related sales lead or inquiry. Non-leads are filtered out to avoid unnecessary processing.

**Nodes Involved:**  
- Gmail Trigger1  
- Classify Potential Leads  
- No Operation, do nothing1

**Node Details:**

- **Gmail Trigger1**  
  - *Type:* Gmail Trigger  
  - *Role:* Watches for new emails arriving to the connected Gmail account.  
  - *Configuration:* Polls every minute, retrieves full email content (`simple:false`), no filters applied.  
  - *Inputs:* None (trigger node)  
  - *Outputs:* Emits email data including text and metadata to next node.  
  - *Errors:* Possible authorization errors if Gmail OAuth2 credentials expire. Occasional API timeouts or rate limits.  
  - *Notes:* Essential entry point for incoming messages.

- **Classify Potential Leads**  
  - *Type:* LangChain Text Classifier  
  - *Role:* Uses AI to classify incoming emails into categories, mainly identifying "AI Leads".  
  - *Configuration:* Uses GPT-4o-mini model (via OpenAI Chat Model node) to detect inquiries about pricing, implementation, or automation needs. Default fallback category is "other".  
  - *Input:* Full email text from Gmail Trigger1  
  - *Output:* Classification category and enriched email data.  
  - *Errors:* AI model failures or API issues. Classification fallback ensures robustness.  
  - *Edge cases:* Emails that are ambiguous or spam may be misclassified; fallback to "other" stops further processing.  
  - *Connections:* Receives language model input from "OpenAI Chat Model (for Classifier)".

- **No Operation, do nothing1**  
  - *Type:* NoOp  
  - *Role:* Terminates workflow path for non-lead emails (those not classified as AI leads).  
  - *Configuration:* None  
  - *Input:* From Classify Potential Leads (if classified as not AI Leads)  
  - *Output:* None (workflow halts here)  
  - *Notes:* Prevents unnecessary processing for irrelevant emails.

| The structured output parser node is crucial to convert AI free-text responses into a strict JSON schema, preventing errors in subsequent email sending nodes. Without this, inconsistencies in AI output format can break the workflow.

| Human review is implemented using Gmail's "sendAndWait" operation, which pauses the workflow until the reviewer responds. This design allows seamless human-in-the-loop control but requires the reviewer to respond promptly to avoid workflow delays.
