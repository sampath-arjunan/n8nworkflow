# Notion Status-Based Alert Messages (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Email)

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates the process of sending alert messages to various communication platforms (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, Email) based on the status of a Notion page. It is designed for teams that track task or project statuses within Notion and want to notify stakeholders automatically when the status changes.

**Target Use Cases:**  
- Teams using Notion to manage projects or content workflows.  
- Automated status-based notifications to multiple channels simultaneously.  
- Centralized alerting without manual message composition.

**Logical Blocks:**  
- **1.1 Input Reception:** Trigger from Notion either via polling or a webhook.  
- **1.2 Notion Page Data Preparation:** Extract and set relevant Notion page details for processing.  
- **1.3 Status-Based Routing:** Switch node routes flow based on Notion page status.  
- **1.4 Message Building:** Compose messages tailored to the current status.  
- **1.5 Multi-Channel Alert Dispatch:** Send the composed message to Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Email (email node is disabled by default).

### 2. Block-by-Block Analysis

#### 1.1 Input Reception

**Overview:**  
This block triggers the workflow when a Notion page changes. It supports two trigger mechanisms: polling and webhook. Only the polling trigger is enabled by default.

**Nodes Involved:**  
- Notion Trigger (Polling)  
- Notion Trigger (Webhook) [disabled]

**Node Details:**  

- **Notion Trigger (Polling)**  
  - Type: Notion Trigger  
  - Role: Polls Notion API for changes in pages to initiate workflow execution.  
  - Configuration: Default polling interval (not specified here), monitors specific Notion database or pages.  
  - Input: None (starts workflow)  
  - Output: Notion page change data  
  - Edge Cases: API rate limits, Notion API downtime, polling delays  
  - Disabled: No  

- **Notion Trigger (Webhook)**  
  - Type: Webhook Trigger  
  - Role: Listens for incoming webhook events from Notion (if set up).  
  - Configuration: Webhook URL generated by n8n; Notion must be configured to send events here.  
  - Input: HTTP POST requests from Notion  
  - Output: Notion page change data  
  - Edge Cases: Webhook misconfiguration, security (exposure), Notion webhook reliability  
  - Disabled: Yes (not active)  

---

#### 1.2 Notion Page Data Preparation

**Overview:**  
Prepares and sets key data extracted from the Notion page for downstream processing, ensuring the workflow has the necessary fields for routing and message building.

**Nodes Involved:**  
- Set Notion Page Info

**Node Details:**  

- **Set Notion Page Info**  
  - Type: Set (data manipulation)  
  - Role: Maps raw Notion trigger data to defined variables/fields for use in the workflow.  
  - Configuration: Likely extracts page status, page ID, title, and other metadata into workflow variables.  
  - Input: Output from Notion Trigger  
  - Output: Structured data with page details  
  - Edge Cases: Missing or malformed data, unexpected Notion schema changes  
  - Version: Uses Set node version 2  

---

#### 1.3 Status-Based Routing

**Overview:**  
Directs the workflow based on the extracted Notion page status value to specific branches that handle message composition for each status.

**Nodes Involved:**  
- Switch

**Node Details:**  

- **Switch**  
  - Type: Switch  
  - Role: Routes execution flow depending on the status field from Notion page info.  
  - Configuration: Switches on specific status values: "On Deck", "In Progress", "Ready For Review", "Ready To Publish".  
  - Input: Data from "Set Notion Page Info" node  
  - Output: Four outputs, each connected to a different "Set" node corresponding to a status.  
  - Edge Cases: Unknown or missing statuses, case sensitivity, triggering multiple branches inadvertently  
  - Version: 3.2  

---

#### 1.4 Message Building

**Overview:**  
For each Notion status, a corresponding "Set" node adds or modifies fields to craft a message appropriate for that status. Then a shared "Build Message" node consolidates the message for dispatch.

**Nodes Involved:**  
- Set On Deck  
- Set In Progress  
- Set Ready For Review  
- Set Ready To Publish  
- Build Message

**Node Details:**  

- **Set On Deck, Set In Progress, Set Ready For Review, Set Ready To Publish**  
  - Type: Set  
  - Role: Each node sets message text, subject, or other status-specific details for the alert message.  
  - Configuration: Hardcoded or dynamic text templates for each status. May include page title, links, or metadata.  
  - Input: From Switch node's respective output  
  - Output: Status-enriched message data  
  - Edge Cases: Missing variables, template errors  
  - Version: 2  

- **Build Message**  
  - Type: Set  
  - Role: Consolidates all message components into a final message structure for sending to channels.  
  - Configuration: Combines data from prior "Set" node with formatting or additional info.  
  - Input: From each status "Set" node  
  - Output: Final message payloads for dispatch nodes  
  - Edge Cases: Expression evaluation errors, missing message content  
  - Version: 2  

---

#### 1.5 Multi-Channel Alert Dispatch

**Overview:**  
Sends the composed alert message to multiple communication platforms in parallel. Slack node is active by default; Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Email nodes are present but disabled.

**Nodes Involved:**  
- Send Slack Msg  
- Send Telegram Msg [disabled]  
- Send WhatsApp Msg [disabled]  
- Send Discord Msg [disabled]  
- Send Email [disabled]

**Node Details:**  

- **Send Slack Msg**  
  - Type: Slack  
  - Role: Sends message to configured Slack workspace/channel.  
  - Configuration: Uses Slack webhook or OAuth credentials (not detailed here). Message payload mapped to Slack format.  
  - Input: Final message from "Build Message"  
  - Output: None (end node)  
  - Edge Cases: Slack API errors, auth failures, channel permission issues  
  - Version: 2.3

### 4. Reproducing the Workflow from Scratch

1. **Create Trigger Node: Notion Trigger (Polling)**  
   - Type: Notion Trigger  
   - Configure to poll the relevant Notion database/page for changes.  
   - Set polling interval as required.  

2. *(Optional)* Create Webhook Trigger (disabled by default) if webhook integration is preferred.

3. **Add Set Node: "Set Notion Page Info"**  
   - Extract important fields from Notion trigger output such as page status, page title, and page URL.  
   - Define variables for status and any metadata needed downstream.

4. **Add Switch Node: "Switch"**  
   - Configure to route on the status field from "Set Notion Page Info".  
   - Define cases for:  
     - "On Deck"  
     - "In Progress"  
     - "Ready For Review"  
     - "Ready To Publish"  

5. **Create Four Set Nodes for Each Status:**  
   - "Set On Deck", "Set In Progress", "Set Ready For Review", "Set Ready To Publish"  
   - Each should set message-specific variables, e.g., message text including page info.  
   - Connect each Switch output to its corresponding Set node.  

6. **Create a Consolidation Set Node: "Build Message"**  
   - Accept input from all four status Set nodes.  
   - Combine text and variables into a final message payload suitable for all output channels.  

7. **Add Channel Sending Nodes:**  
   - "Send Slack Msg" (Slack node)  
     - Configure Slack OAuth2 or incoming webhook credentials.  
     - Map message payload to Slack message format.  
   - Optionally add and configure:  
     - "Send Telegram Msg" (Telegram node) with bot token and chat ID.  
     - "Send WhatsApp Msg" (WhatsApp node) with appropriate API credentials.  
     - "Send Discord Msg" (Discord node) with webhook URL or bot token.  
     - "Send Email" (Email Send node) with SMTP or other email credentials.  
   - Connect all these nodes to "Build Message" output.

8. **Link Connections:**  
   - Notion Trigger (Polling) → Set Notion Page Info  
   - Set Notion Page Info → Switch  
   - Switch outputs → respective Set status nodes  
   - Each Set status node → Build Message  
   - Build Message → all Send nodes  

9. **Test each node and configure error handling as necessary:**  
   - Check API credentials  
   - Validate message payloads  
   - Consider adding error triggers or fallback nodes (not in original workflow)
