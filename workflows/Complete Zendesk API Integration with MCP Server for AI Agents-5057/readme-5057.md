# Complete Zendesk API Integration with MCP Server for AI Agents

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow implements a **Complete Zendesk API Integration** designed to interact with Zendesk’s ticketing, user, and organization management via an MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) Server node tailored for AI agents. It facilitates comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Zendesk resources, exposing them through a centralized MCP Server webhook for AI-driven automation or conversational agents.

The workflow is logically structured into four main functional blocks, each encapsulating a set of related Zendesk API operations:

- **1.1 MCP Server Trigger:** Receives requests from AI agents or external clients via the MCP Server node, acting as the entry point.
- **1.2 Ticket Management:** Handles all ticket-related operations including create, read, update, delete, recover, and batch retrieval.
- **1.3 Ticket Field Management:** Manages metadata fields associated with tickets, including retrieval of single or multiple ticket fields.
- **1.4 User Management:** Covers operations on Zendesk users such as create, read, update, delete, search, and fetching associated organizations or related data.
- **1.5 Organization Management:** Performs CRUD and related data retrieval operations on Zendesk organizations.

Each Zendesk operation node is linked back to the MCP Server trigger node as an AI tool, enabling centralized control and orchestration of the API calls through AI agent commands.

### 2. Block-by-Block Analysis

#### 2.1 MCP Server Trigger

- **Overview:**  
  Acts as the webhook trigger node that listens for incoming AI agent requests routed through the MCP Server. It is the gateway that dispatches commands to the appropriate Zendesk operation nodes.

  - Configuration: Uses an autogenerated webhookId, no additional parameters needed  
  - Inputs: External HTTP POST requests from AI agents or clients  
  - Outputs: Routes incoming AI tool commands to connected Zendesk operation nodes via the `ai_tool` connection  
  - Version Requirements: n8n version supporting MCP nodes (Langchain integration)  
  - Edge Cases: Webhook authentication or rate limiting issues; malformed requests; downtime of MCP Server  
  - Sub-workflow: None

   - "Get many ticket fields": Configure to fetch multiple ticket fields metadata

6. **Connect Ticket Field Nodes**  
   - Connect output `ai_tool` of "Zendesk Tool MCP Server" to these nodes as well

7. **Add User Management Nodes:**  
   - "Create a user", "Get a user", "Update a user", "Delete a user", "Get many users", "Search a user", "Get a user's organizations", "Get data related to a user"  
   - Configure each node for the respective Zendesk user API call

8. **Connect User Nodes**
