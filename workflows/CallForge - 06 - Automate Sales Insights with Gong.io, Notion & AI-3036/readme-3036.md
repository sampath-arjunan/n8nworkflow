# CallForge - 06 - Automate Sales Insights with Gong.io, Notion & AI

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow, **CallForge - AI-Powered Sales Call Data Processor**, automates the extraction, categorization, and storage of sales call insights generated by AI transcription and analysis tools such as Gong.io, Fireflies.ai, or Otter.ai. It targets sales teams, sales operations managers, and revenue teams who want to streamline the processing of sales call intelligence by automatically identifying competitor mentions, objections, integrations, and customer use cases, then storing these structured insights in Notion databases.

The workflow is logically divided into the following blocks:

- **1.1 Input Reception and Trigger**: Receives AI-generated sales call data from an external source.
- **1.2 Core AI Data Update**: Updates the main Notion call record with summarized AI insights.
- **1.3 Competitor Data Processing**: Checks for competitor mentions, splits and processes each competitor entry, and creates corresponding Notion database pages.
- **1.4 Integration Data Processing**: Checks for integration mentions, splits and processes each integration entry, and creates corresponding Notion database pages.
- **1.5 Objection Data Processing**: Checks for objections, splits objection tags, formats them, updates Notion with objection tags, and updates the call record with objection summaries.
- **1.6 Use Case Data Processing**: Checks for customer use cases, splits and processes each use case, and creates corresponding Notion database pages.
- **1.7 Rate Limiting and Sequencing**: Implements wait nodes to handle API rate limits and ensure smooth sequencing of Notion API calls.

### 4. Reproducing the Workflow from Scratch

1. **Create the Trigger Node**  
   - Add an **Execute Workflow Trigger** node. No parameters needed. This node will receive AI-generated sales call data including `AIoutput` and `notionData`.

2. **Add Core Data Update Node**  
   - Add a **Notion** node configured to update a database page.  
   - Operation: Update page.  
   - Page ID: Set dynamically from `Execute Workflow Trigger` node's `notionData[0].id`.  
   - Properties to update:  
     - Call Summary (rich_text) ← `AIoutput.CallSummary`  
     - Next Steps (rich_text) ← formatted bullet list from `AIoutput.NextSteps`  
     - Sentiment (select) ← `AIoutput.Sentiment`  
     - Customer Pain Points (rich_text) ← formatted bullet list from `AIoutput.CustomerPainPoints`  
   - Credentials: Connect your Notion API credentials.

3. **Competitor Data Processing**  
   - Add an **If** node named "Check if Competitor Data Found" with condition: length of `AIoutput.Competitors` ≥ 1.  
   - On true branch:  
     - Add a **Wait** node ("Wait for rate limiting - Competitors") with 3 seconds delay.  
     - Add a **Set** node ("Get AI Response - Competitors") to assign `aiResponse` from `AIoutput`.  
     - Add a **SplitOut** node ("Split Out Competitor Data") to split `aiResponse.Competitors`.  
     - Add a **Notion** node ("Create Competitors in DB") to create pages in the Competitors database:  
       - Database ID: Your Competitors database ID.  
       - Properties: Map fields such as Name, Competitor Status, Summary, Pricing Summary, Competitor Tracked?, Competitor Sentiment, Mentioned Date, and relation to the call page.  
       - Icon: 🤺  
       - Credentials: Notion API.  
     - Add an **Aggregate** node ("Bundle Competitor Data to 1 object") to aggregate created competitor pages.  
     - Add a **Set** node ("Merge Competitor Thread") to merge aggregated data back.

4. **Integration Data Processing**  
   - Add an **If** node ("Check if Integration Data Found") with condition: length of `AIoutput.Integrations` ≥ 1.  
   - On true branch:  
     - Add a **Wait** node ("Wait for rate limiting - Integration") with 3 seconds delay.  
     - Add a **SplitOut** node ("Split Out Integration data") to split `AIoutput.Integrations`.  
     - Add a **Notion** node ("Create Integrations") to create pages in the Integrations database:  
       - Database ID: Your Integrations database ID.  
       - Properties: Map fields such as Name, Integration Status, Summary, Usage Status, and relation to the call page.  
       - Icon: ⚙️  
       - Credentials: Notion API.  
     - Add an **Aggregate** node ("Bundle Integration Data to 1 object") to aggregate created integration pages.  
     - Add a **Set** node ("Merge Integration Thread") to merge aggregated data back.

5. **Objection Data Processing**  
   - Add an **If** node ("Check if objection found") with condition: `AIoutput.Objection.Nature` is not empty.  
   - On true branch:  
     - Add a **Wait** node ("Wait for rate limiting - Objection") with 3 seconds delay.  
     - Add a **SplitOut** node ("Split Out all objections") to split `AIoutput.Objection.ObjectionTags`.  
     - Add a **Set** node ("Format Tag Data for notion") to format each tag as `{ "name": "<tag>" }`.  
     - Add an **Aggregate** node ("Bundle all Tags") to aggregate formatted tags.  
     - Add an **HTTP Request** node ("Add Objection Tag to Notion"):  
       - Method: PATCH  
       - URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/{{pageId}}` where `pageId` is from trigger node.  
       - Body (JSON): Update multi-select property "Objections" with aggregated tags.  
       - Headers: Include `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28`.  
       - Authentication: Use Notion API credentials.  
     - Add a **Wait** node ("Wait for rate limiting again") with 4 seconds delay.  
     - Add a **Notion** node ("Update Call with Objection Summary") to update the call page's "Objection Summary" rich text with `AIoutput.Objection.Nature`.  
     - Add a **Set** node ("Merge Objection Threads") to merge objection data back.

6. **Use Case Data Processing**  
   - Add an **If** node ("Check for use cases") with condition: length of `AIoutput.UseCases` ≥ 1.  
   - On true branch:  
     - Add a **Wait** node ("Wait for rate limiting - Use Cases") with 3 seconds delay.  
     - Add a **SplitOut** node ("Split Out Use Cases") to split `AIoutput.UseCases`.  
     - Add a **Notion** node ("Create Use Cases") to create pages in the Use Cases database:  
       - Database ID: Your Use Cases database ID.  
       - Properties: Map fields such as Summary (title), Department Tag (multi-select), Industry Tag (multi-select), Implementation (select), and relation to the call page.  
       - Icon: 💼  
       - Credentials: Notion API.  
     - Add an **Aggregate** node ("Bundle Use Case Data to 1 object") to aggregate created use case pages.  
     - Add a **Set** node ("Merge Use Case Thread") to merge aggregated data back.

7. **Connect Nodes**  
   - Connect the trigger node to all four If nodes and the core Notion update node.  
   - Connect each If node's true branch to its respective wait node, then to split, create, aggregate, and merge nodes sequentially.  
   - Connect the objection processing nodes in sequence including the HTTP request and final update.  
   - Ensure all wait nodes are placed before Notion API calls to handle rate limiting.

8. **Credentials Setup**  
   - Configure Notion API credentials in n8n with access to all relevant databases.  
   - Ensure the API key has permissions to read and write pages in Competitors, Integrations, Use Cases, and Calls databases.

9. **Testing**  
   - Test the workflow with sample AI-generated call data containing competitors, objections, integrations, and use cases.  
   - Verify that Notion pages are created/updated correctly and that rate limiting does not cause errors.
