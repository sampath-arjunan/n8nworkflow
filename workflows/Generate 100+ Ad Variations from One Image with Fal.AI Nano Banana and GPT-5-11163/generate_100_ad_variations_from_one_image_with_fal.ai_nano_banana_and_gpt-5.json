Image Variants:** ~$4.00\n\n### **Step 1: The Automation Trigger**\nThis workflow uses a built-in **n8n Form**.\n*   Open the \"On form submission\" node.\n*   Copy the **Test URL** or **Production URL** to share with your team.\n*   Fields include: *Company Name, Ad Inspiration (Upload), Creative Recipe, & Copywriting Inspiration*.\n\n### **Step 2: Connect Google Drive**\n*   Add your **Google Drive** credentials in n8n.\n*   **Input:** The workflow uploads your reference image to a Drive folder (Update `folderId` in \"Upload file\").\n*   **Output:** Generated images are saved to a specific folder (Update `folderId` in \"Upload generated ad...\").\n\n### **Step 3: Connect OpenAI**\nThe automation uses **GPT-4o Mini** to analyze your image and rewrite prompts.\n*   Add your **OpenAI API Key** to the \"Describe ad selected\" and \"Create variants\" nodes.\n\n### **Step 4: Set Up Fal.ai**\n*   Sign up at [fal.ai](https://fal.ai) and get your API Key.\n*   Update the **HTTP Request** nodes (\"Submit Request...\", \"Get Image status\", \"Get image url\").\n*   Replace the `Authorization` header with: `Key <YOUR_API_KEY>`.\n\n### **Step 5: View Results**\nOnce submitted, the automation analyzes the reference, generates prompts based on your \"Recipe\" (e.g., *The Metaphor Bake*), and saves the final images to your Google Drive output folder.\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n*   **Looping:** Images are processed one by one.\n*   **Permissions:** Ensure your Google Drive connection has read/write access to the defined folders.\n*   **Support:** Contact
