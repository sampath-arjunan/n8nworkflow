# 🛠️ Splunk Tool MCP Server 💪 all 16 operations

### 1. Workflow Overview

This n8n workflow, titled **"Splunk Tool MCP Server"**, is designed to provide a comprehensive interface for executing and managing 16 different operations related to Splunk through the n8n platform. The workflow targets advanced users and automation agents who need programmatic control over Splunk’s data searching, reporting, user management, and alert retrieval functionalities.

The workflow is logically divided into four main blocks, each grouping related Splunk operations to simplify management and scaling:

- **1.1 Trigger Reception:** Receives external calls or events that specify which Splunk operation to perform.
- **1.2 Alert and Metrics Retrieval:** Handles fetching fired alerts reports and metrics from Splunk.
- **1.3 Search Reports Management:** Manages creation, retrieval, deletion, and listing of search reports.
- **1.4 Search Jobs Management:** Facilitates creation, retrieval, deletion, listing of search jobs, and retrieving their results.
- **1.5 User Management:** Manages user creation, retrieval, update, deletion, and listing within Splunk.

Each block contains multiple Splunk Tool nodes, all connected to the central MCP Trigger node that acts as the entry point and decision-maker routing incoming requests to the appropriate operation.

### 4. Reproducing the Workflow from Scratch

1. **Create the MCP Trigger Node**  
   - Add a new node of type `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcpTrigger`.  
   - Name it "Splunk Tool MCP Server".  
   - Configure it to generate or use an existing webhook for receiving external requests. No extra parameters are needed.  
   - This node serves as the workflow entry point.

2. **Add Splunk Tool Nodes for Alert and Metrics Retrieval**  
   - Add two `Splunk Tool` nodes named:  
     - "Get a fired alerts report"  
     - "Get metrics"  
   - Configure each node with appropriate Splunk credentials and parameters for the respective API calls (alert reports and metrics).  
   - Connect the output of "Splunk Tool MCP Server" to each node’s input via "ai_tool" connection.

3. **Add Splunk Tool Nodes for Search Reports Management**  
   - Add four `Splunk Tool` nodes:  
     - "Create a search report"  
     - "Delete a search report"  
     - "Get a search report"  
     - "Get many search reports"  
   - Configure each with Splunk credentials and set parameters according to the function, such as report ID for get/delete, or search query for create.  
   - Connect all nodes’ inputs to the MCP Trigger node.

4. **Add Splunk Tool Nodes for Search Jobs Management**  
   - Add five `Splunk Tool` nodes:  
     - "Create a search job"  
     - "Delete a search job"  
     - "Get a search job"  
     - "Get many search jobs"  
     - "Get the result of a search job"  
   - Ensure each node is configured with Splunk credentials and API parameters corresponding to job management.  
   - Connect all to MCP Trigger node.

5. **Add Splunk Tool Nodes for User Management**  
   - Add five `Splunk Tool` nodes:  
     - "Create a user"  
     - "Delete a user"  
     - "Get a user"  
     - "Get many users"  
     - "Update a user"  
   - Configure credentials and parameters for user lifecycle management in Splunk.  
   - Connect each node’s input to the MCP Trigger node.

6. **Add Sticky Notes (Optional for Documentation)**  
   - Add sticky notes near groups of related nodes for clarity or instructions.

7. **Configure Credentials**  
   - Create and assign Splunk credentials to each Splunk Tool node.  
   - Ensure appropriate permissions for API access are granted.

8. **Activate and Test**  
   - Activate the workflow.  
   - Test by triggering the webhook with different operation requests to verify each node performs as expected.
