# Create Recurring AI-Powered Data Digests in Slack with Super Assistant

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates the creation and delivery of recurring AI-powered data digests to a Slack channel. It is designed for teams and organizations that want to receive synthesized summaries or progress reports generated by a custom AI assistant built in Super (super.work). The workflow schedules a recurring query, sends it to the Super AI assistant, retrieves the synthesized answer, and posts it as a formatted message in Slack.

The logic is divided into the following functional blocks:

- **1.1 Schedule Trigger:** Defines when the digest should be created and sent.
- **1.2 Query Preparation:** Sets the specific question to ask the AI assistant.
- **1.3 AI Processing via Super Assistant:** Sends the query to the Super API and retrieves the response.
- **1.4 Slack Notification:** Posts the AI-generated digest into a designated Slack channel.
- **1.5 Documentation and Guidance:** Sticky Notes provide instructions, configuration tips, and context for users setting up the workflow.
