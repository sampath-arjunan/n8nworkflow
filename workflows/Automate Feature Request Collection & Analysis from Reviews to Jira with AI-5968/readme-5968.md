# Automate Feature Request Collection & Analysis from Reviews to Jira with AI

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates the collection, analysis, and tracking of feature requests extracted from user reviews on external review sites (e.g., Trustpilot). Its primary target use case is product management teams seeking to gather real user feedback and convert it directly into actionable Jira tickets without manual copy-pasting or analysis.

The workflow is divided into three main logical blocks:

- **1.1 Start and Target Setup**: Provides manual triggering and editable input for the review site URL to initiate the workflow.

- **1.2 Scrape and Structure User Reviews**: Uses an AI-powered agent combined with a Bright Data MCP scraper and OpenAI models to extract, parse, and optionally analyze user reviews, producing a structured list of feature requests.

- **1.3 Convert Reviews into Jira Tasks**: Processes each individual review and creates a corresponding Jira issue for tracking and prioritization.
