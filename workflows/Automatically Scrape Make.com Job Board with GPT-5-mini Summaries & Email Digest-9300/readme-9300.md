# Automatically Scrape Make.com Job Board with GPT-5-mini Summaries & Email Digest

---

### 1. Workflow Overview

This workflow automates the process of scraping job postings from the Make.com professional services forum, generating AI-powered summaries for each posting, and sending a weekly email digest of the latest job opportunities. It is designed for users who want to monitor new job openings efficiently with summarized content generated by GPT-5-mini, providing a clear and concise overview of each listing.

The workflow is logically divided into the following blocks:

- **1.1 Scheduled Trigger & Data Fetching:** Initiates the workflow weekly and fetches the main job board HTML.
- **1.2 Data Extraction & Filtering:** Extracts job posting links and metadata, formats them, and filters for recent posts (last 7 days).
- **1.3 Individual Job Processing & AI Summarization:** Retrieves individual job pages, extracts detailed HTML, and uses GPT-5-mini to generate structured summaries.
- **1.4 Data Aggregation & Email Digest Preparation:** Combines AI summaries with job metadata, cleans the data, aggregates all jobs, and formats a grouped HTML email.
- **1.5 Email Delivery:** Sends the formatted job digest email to the configured recipient.
